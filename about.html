      <p>
        I am <b>Paulo Medina</b>, a purpose-oriented Data professional. With
        <b>5 years</b> of experience, I have worked in different settings,
        from fieldwork in Paraguay <b>managing</b> large timber production
        operations to supporting high quality data outputs for the
        <b>Demographic and Health Surveys Program</b> as a Geospatial Data
        Scientist. <br /><br />I am currently deepening my knowledge in GIS as
        a MSc student at the
        <a href="https://geospatial.umd.edu/education/master-science-geospatial-information-sciences">Geospatial
          Information Sciences program at UMD</a>.
      
          <br><br>
        I thrive in multicultural environments, having lived in Paraguay,
        Brazil, the US, and collaborated with partners from Mali, Mozambique,
        and Europe. I am also fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, Guarani, English,
        and French. I am passionate about sharing knowledge, nature, and art.
        I am profoundly purpose driven.
     <br><br>
      
        In my free time I teach English for non-native speakers, translate
        texts from Spanish to English, and enjoy time with my family.
